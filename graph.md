# Graph

## Graph Representation
- Adjajency Matrix 
- Adjajency List
- [Object and Pointers](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/clone-graph/)

## Traversal

### DFS
 - Number of Connected Components
 - Strongly Connected Graph
 - [Number of Islands.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/)
 - Print all paths from src to dest in a graph.
 
 ### BFS
 
 - Graph is Bipartite or not
 - [Smallest multiple with zero and one](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-smallest-binary-digit-multiple-of-given-number/)
 - [Stepping Numbers](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/stepping-numbers/)
 - [Diameter of a tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-path-undirected-tree/)
 - [Diameter of a tree when only links to parent given (V.Good Ques)](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/largest-distance-between-nodes-of-a-tree/)
 - [Word Ladder -> Min steps to transform one string to another when only one character can change at a time and intermediary string can only be the ones that are present in given dictionary](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/word-ladder-i/)
 
 ## Minimum Spanning Tree 
 - Prim's Algo
 - Kruskal Algo
 
 ## Shortest Path
  - Dijkstra's Algo -> Shortest Path between two nodes.
  - Floys-Warshall Algo -> Shortest Path Between all points
  - [Transitive Clousure of a Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transitive-closure-of-a-graph/)
  
 ## Other Problems:
  - K Clustering Problem.
  - Detect cycle in a directed graph
  - Topological Sort
    - [Course Schedule](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/possibility-of-finishing-all-courses-given-prerequisites/)
    -  Similar to Course Schedule is deadlock detection. We use DFS for this and by having 3 phases.-> visited, inProcess, unvisited. Deadlock is detected when inProcess requires an inProcess node.
