### some Multi Threading Question

1. Multiple threads producing and multiple threads consuming , write an effective program that should be scalable. (Not Distributed, No Msgs, use pure java)
2. We have an updateAccount() method, multiple users call this method. Another method , getBalanceSheet() is also used by many users. design classes  such that these two are scalable in concurrent environment. Balance sheet should have individual accounts. We should have transactionIds, Time of transaction etc. (Not Distributed, No Msgs, use pure java) 

Solve both by writing all classes.
